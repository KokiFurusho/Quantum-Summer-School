# Semiclassical QFT (or iQFT)
Also called: Semi-classical Phase Estimation, Measure-and-Feedforward QFT

* Description: As you measure each qubit (starting from the least significant), you apply corrections to subsequent qubits, thereby eliminating many controlled gates. This technique can be a big gate-count saver for phase estimation (and thus for Shor).
