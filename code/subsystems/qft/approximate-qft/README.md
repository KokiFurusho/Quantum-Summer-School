# Approximate (Truncated) QFT

Also called: Truncated QFT, Phase-Truncated QFT

* Description: Reduces the number of phase gates by truncating small rotations, speeding up the QFT at the cost of slight approximation error. Commonly used in Shorâ€™s algorithm to reduce circuit depth (especially for large registers).
