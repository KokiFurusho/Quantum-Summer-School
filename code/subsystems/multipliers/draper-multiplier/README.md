# QFT-Based (Draper) Multiplier

### Concept

* Utilizes the Quantum Fourier Transform to perform multiplication in the frequency domain.
* Similar spirit to the Draper adder, but extended to handle multiplication.

### Pros

* Potentially fewer carry operations in the time domain.
* Shows off QFT-based arithmetic as a “clean” conceptual approach.

### Cons

* Requires many controlled-phase gates.
* May be sensitive to approximations or truncated phases to be practical.
