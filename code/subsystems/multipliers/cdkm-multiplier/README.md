# CDKM or Vedral-Barenco-Ekert (VBE) Multiplier

### Concept

* These multipliers are often part of broader quantum arithmetic frameworks proposed in the same papers that ntroduced improved adders.
* “CDKM” is from Draper, Kutin, Rains, Svore (sometimes referencing Takahashi-Kunihiro improvements).
* VBE is from Vedral, Barenco, and Ekert (1996), originally describing an adder, but has extensions to ultiplication.

### Pros

* Typically optimized for fewer gates or lower depth than naive approaches.
* Well-documented in quantum computing literature.

### Cons

* Implementation complexity is higher.
* Harder to find straightforward references or code examples compared to simpler “repeated addition.”
