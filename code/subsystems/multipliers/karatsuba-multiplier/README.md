# Karatsuba or Toom-Cook Multipliers (Asymptotically Faster Methods)

### Concept

* In classical arithmetic for large numbers, Karatsuba multiplication reduces the complexity below 𝑂(𝑛^2).
* Toom-Cook (and further generalizations like Schönhage–Strassen in the classical domain) continue to reduce symptotic complexity.
* Quantum analogs exist that try to replicate these divide-and-conquer strategies.

### Pros

* Lower asymptotic complexity for very large 𝑛.
* Potential for significantly fewer operations if implemented well.

### Cons

* Implementation can be complicated.
* For small to medium 𝑛, overhead might outweigh the theoretical benefits.
